make a function which will swap 2 values acording to comparing them. 
eg:
    origignal = [1,3,2,5,4,6]
    modified by swap(function name) = [1,2,3,5,4,6]

Swap:
    first will check if the numbers are sorted
    eg:
        list = [1,2,3,4,5,7,6]
                         â†‘
        will go fine till here...
        then it will realise that 7 and 6 should be swapped.
        swap using if condition. 
        the if condition will first go on the second number in the pair and then consider the first number. 

When the function is functioning properly we can put it in a loop which will implement the
repeated swaping.
The origignal list should be of dynamic type so we can assign it to itself. 
We will use the sorted function from our repo and clarify the ending of the loop.
eg:
    while(True) {
        list = Swap(list);
        decBreak = sorted(list)
        if(decBreak == true) {
            break
        }
    }
