make a function which will swap 2 values acording to comparing values. 
eg:
    origignal = [1,3,2,5,4,6]
    modified by function = [1,2,3,5,4,6]

When the function is functioning properly we can put it in a loop which will implement the
repeated swaping.
The origignal list should be of dynamic type so we can assign it to itself. 
We will use the sorted function from our repo and clarify the ending of the loop.
eg:
    while(True) {
        list = function name(list);
        decBreak = sorted(list)
        if(decBreak == true) {
            break
        }
    }
