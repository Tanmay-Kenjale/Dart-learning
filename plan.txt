make a function which will swap 2 values acording to comparing values. 
eg:
    origignal = [1,3,2,5,4,6]
    modified by function = [1,2,3,5,4,6]

when the function is functioning properly we can put it in a loop which will implement the
repeated swaping.
The origignal list should be of dynamic type so we can assign it to itself
eg:
    while(True) {
        list = function name(list);
    }
